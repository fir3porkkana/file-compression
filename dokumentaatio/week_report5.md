## Report for week 5

i spent friday figuring out how to include the Huffman tree itself within the encoded and compressed file, and almost finished it. i'm about 80% through with it. additionally, i started converting the project documentation into english as i'd written my documentation in finnish and my code in english for some unknown reason up until this point. colloquially, a brain fart. 

after the so-called "modularity update" into the compression, i can actually implement compressing actual files and a better usability. after that, the program should actually be capable of serving some sort of purpose (instead of just being more of a proof of concept than a piece of utility). tests will also come around soon. regrettably, the core functionality of the program didn't change much at all from the outside this week.

timewise, i spent about 7 hours all around.
