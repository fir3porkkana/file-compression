## Report for week 6

i spent friday falling insane with this modularity update i was figuring out last week. it now, sometimes, works "modularly", so to speak. it's buggy, but it works around 70% or the time depending on the input. however, i'm not sure if i've ever had more anxiety because of a coding project. i can't do this anymore, i'll have to postpone fixing it to saturday or sunday.

because of this week turning out the way it did, nothing else has progressed.


timewise, i spent about 8 hours all around.
